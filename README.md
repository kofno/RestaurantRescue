# Restaurant Rescue

This is an example of a text adventure or "interactive fiction". It's written
for the web using TypeScript, React, and MobX.

As an example, it demonstrates a small feature set:

    * Small set of declarative interactions
    * Simple link based navigation
    * Inventory and world based interactions

I was intrigued to try this after playing around with RenPy and the Elm Narrative
Engine.
